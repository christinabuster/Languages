          <h1>Ruby on Rails</h1>Ruby on Rails is a web-application framework written in Ruby, an object-oriented programming language. Many top sites including Hulu, Twitter, Airbnb, and Groupon use Rails in building their web applications. This course is aimed at beginners and starts by teaching you the basics of coding in Ruby, and then takes those skills and applies them to understanding the framework of Rails.

            <div class="panel-body">
              SQL is used by large companies to update or retrieve information from a database. Corporations with huge amounts of information within their database rely on those with an understanding of SQL to analyze that data to better understand their audience and help determine which directions to move in going forward. Through the course you’ll learn to use your newfound knowledge to make data-driven decisions that put your company in the best position to succeed.

            <div class="panel-body">
              Java is a programming language used to create applications on your computer. It is an object-oriented programming language, meaning its focus is on objects rather than actions. It is so ubiquitous that chances are you have downloaded Java onto your computer before in order to run a program, even if you didn’t know you were doing it at the time. This course is meant to serve as an intro to both Java and object-oriented programming as a whole, both of which will help you to learn other languages later on.

              Despite the similarities in their name, Java and JavaScript are extremely different beasts to tame in the world of coding. JavaScript is primarily a scripting language used within HTML pages and is utilized by the majority of the websites you visit. This course is meant for those with a basic understanding of HTML who are hoping to expand their base of knowledge.

              C# (pronounce “See Sharp,” like the music note) is a C-variant programming language, meaning that much of the syntax and structure will help in learning other languages, such as C++ and Java. C# was developed and is still maintained by Microsoft, and more features are always being added. It is used as the go-to choice for most programmers building Windows desktop applications.

            C++ is another C-variant language and is popular in some circles for game development, as well as at many large banking institutions. This course is meant for those completely new to coding and promises to get you to a working proficiency through 12 hours of content and over 54 lectures.

              Objective-C can be considered the C# of the OSx and iOS world. The Apple computer company released Objective-C in the 1980’s when it was still a relatively young company. Since then Objective-C has1 become the de facto language for software developed for Apple products including the iPhone and iPod.

              Swift is a programming language created by Apple for iOS. Through Swift you can create your own iPhone applications and release them on the App Store. This course is for those who hope to eventually build apps as a profession, and teaches students by building actual working apps — at increasing degrees of complexity.

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
              Python is a scripting language like JavaScript, but the two still have differences between them in terms of syntax and execution. Python is considered by many to be one of the more simple coding languages to learn, as it places less of an emphasis on syntax than other languages. If you forget your parentheses or misplace a few semicolons, it shouldn't trip you up as much as it might if you were coding in another one. This course is focused on getting you comfortable with the concepts of Python and directly applying it to applications.
